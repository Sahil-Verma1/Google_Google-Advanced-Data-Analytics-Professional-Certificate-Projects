# 🚗 Waze Traffic Analysis Project

This project is part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** and aims to analyze traffic patterns using data from **Waze**, a community-driven navigation app. The goal is to identify potential causes of increased congestion and suggest actionable recommendations for city planners.

## 📊 Project Overview

Waze, in partnership with the city of **Iron Mountain**, provided traffic-related data to help solve congestion issues. The analysis focuses on understanding traffic patterns, user reports, and identifying root causes for delays.

### Key Objectives:
- Clean and prepare raw traffic data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify trends and peak congestion times
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data cleaning & transformation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis & documentation

## 📌 Highlights

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Missing values and duplicates handled efficiently using Pandas.
- 📈 **EDA**: Visualized accident reports, traffic jams, and weather events to uncover patterns.
- 🔍 **Insight Discovery**: Identified peak hours and locations of recurring congestion.
- 📝 **Recommendations**: Proposed solutions like signal timing changes and road signage adjustments.

## 💡 Insights for Decision Makers

- Most congestion occurs during weekday rush hours (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM).
- High frequency of accidents and hazards reported in specific intersections.
- Weather events like snow and rain significantly impact traffic speed.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Activity_Course 4 Waze project lab.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full analysis.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Incorporate machine learning to predict traffic congestion
- Connect real-time API data for dynamic insights
- Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Streamlit
