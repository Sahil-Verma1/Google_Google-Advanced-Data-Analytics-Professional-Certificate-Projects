# 📍 Waze Project Lab – Course 3: Data Exploration & Preparation

This project is part of **Course 3 (Prepare) of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. The goal is to lay the foundation for traffic congestion analysis using **Waze** data by focusing on the early stages of the data analysis process: asking questions, preparing data, and verifying its integrity.

## 📌 Project Objective

Before diving into analytics, it's essential to understand the problem, define goals, and prepare the data. This project sets the stage for deeper analysis by:
- Framing business questions
- Identifying the right data sources
- Evaluating data for completeness and integrity

## 💼 Business Task

Waze and the city of **Iron Mountain** aim to reduce traffic congestion by understanding where and why delays occur. This notebook documents the early steps of that journey.

### Key Tasks Covered:
- Understand the problem context and stakeholders
- Explore and validate the Waze traffic data
- Clean and standardize raw datasets for future analysis

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data exploration & cleaning
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Documentation of process

## ✅ Key Contributions

- 🧠 **Ask Phase**: Defined stakeholders, problem context, and data needs.
- 📥 **Prepare Phase**: Loaded and examined Waze data for accuracy and reliability.
- 🔍 **Integrity Check**: Verified data types, checked for missing values and duplicates.
- 📊 **Data Readiness**: Cleaned dataset ready for visualization and deeper EDA (done in Course 4).
